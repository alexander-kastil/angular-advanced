- Examine `async-pipe.component.ts` and its use of `ngOnDestroy`and the `taskSubscription`.
- Examine `take-until-destroyed.component.ts` and how it unsubscribes from the observable when the component is destroyed. 
- This is a recommended pattern when dealing with multiple subscriptions in a component.
