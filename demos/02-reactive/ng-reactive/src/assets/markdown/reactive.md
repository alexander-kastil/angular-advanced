- One of the benefits of declarative reactivity is that it allows us to consume the data stream directly and assign it to props or vars of type Observable<T>. 
- This means that we don't have to manually subscribe or unsubscribe to the data stream, which can be error-prone and lead to memory leaks. 
- Instead, we can use RxJS operators to manipulate the data stream as needed, such as filtering, mapping, combining, etc. 
- The component rendering is then bound to the props or vars that hold the observable values, and often uses the async pipe to handle

```typescript
skills$ = this.service.getSkills().pipe(
    combineLatestWith(this.filter$.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(''))),
    map(([skills, filter]) => {
      return filter == ''
        ? skills
        : skills.filter((skill: Skill) => skill.name.includes(filter));
    })
  );
```
