# Components & Composition

| # | Route | Title | Teaches |
|---|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | standalone | Standalone Component | Create standalone components without NgModule. Declare dependencies directly in the component decorator with imports, providers, and styles. |
| 2 | control-flow | Control Flow | Use modern Angular control flow syntax with @if, @for, @switch, and @let. Replace ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch with cleaner, more performant alternatives. |
| 3 | content-projection | Content Projection | Design flexible components with <ng-content> slots. Pass template content to child components using named projections and default content. |
| 4 | directives-composition | Directives Composition | Combine multiple directives on a single element to compose behaviors. Use hostDirectives to attach directives as component dependencies. |
| 5 | content-child | Content Child | Query projected content with @ContentChild and @ContentChildren. Access and interact with elements passed via content projection. |
| 6 | view-queries | View Queries | Query template elements with @ViewChild and @ViewChildren. Obtain references to child components or DOM elements in the component view. |
| 7 | template-vs-container | Template vs Container | Understand the difference between ng-template and ng-container. Control when and where template content is rendered in the DOM. |
| 8 | host-binding | Host Binding & Listener | Manage component host properties and events with @HostBinding and @HostListener. Style the component element and respond to user interactions. |
| 9 | container-presenter | Container Presenter | Separate data logic (container) from presentation (presenter) components. Use this pattern for cleaner, more reusable component architecture. |
| 10 | dynamic-components | Dynamic Components | Create and insert components dynamically at runtime using ViewContainerRef. Pass data to dynamic components and handle their lifecycle. |
| 11 | lazy-standalone | Lazy Standalone Comp. | Load standalone components on-demand via routes. Reduce initial bundle size by lazy loading features that aren't immediately needed. |
| 12 | standalone-bootstrap | Load Standalone Apps | Bootstrap standalone applications with bootstrapApplication(). Set up providers, routes, and configuration without NgModule. |
