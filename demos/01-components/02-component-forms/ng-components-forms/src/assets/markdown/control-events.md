Angular 18 introduced a new feature called `Unified Control Events`. 

Unified Control Events are a way to listen to events on a form control using a single subscription. 

This is useful when you want to listen to events on a form control and react to them. 

It provides the following event types:

```typescript
- ValueChangeEvent 
- StatusChangeEvent
- PristineChangeEvent
- TouchChangeEvent
```
