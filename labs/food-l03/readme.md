# Food App Project - Reactive Programming

- Use a responsive mat-sidenav-container to enable toggle the left nav. Implement the toggle functionality in an stateful `menu.service.ts` using a BehaviourSubject. You can refactor this to use ngrx later on.

- Take the following as a reference from the demo project:

  - `DemoContainerComponent`
  - `NavbarComponent`
  - `menu.service.ts`
